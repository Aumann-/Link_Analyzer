URL analyzer wirtten in R for link data generated by web crawler and converter program.

Current Features:

Takes in a csv file for duplicates/tocrawl file types, read data into a data.frame, and generates an interactive scatterplot from the data. The plot is opened in a windows graph area so the analyzer will currently only function in Windows OS. Each point on the plot is interactive in that mousing over the point will give the link name and how man y times it occurred in the file.


Future Features:
Read in a converted crawled file and generate a flowchart sitemap of each link in the file and its position relative to each other link.
