URL analyzer wirtten in R for link data generated by web crawler and converter program.

Requires rglPlotCustom package.

NOW WITH GUI


Current Features:

plot_dups():

Takes in a csv file for duplicates/tocrawl file types, read data into a data.frame, and generates an interactive scatterplot from the data. The plot is opened in a windows graph area so the analyzer will currently only function in Windows OS. Each point on the plot is interactive in that mousing over the point will give the link name and how man y times it occurred in the file.


plot_crawled():

Takes in a crawled links file, reads the data into a data.frame, and cleans the data into a good format to generate a tree from. Once cleaning is complete, the links are plotted on a 3D layout. The generated tree can be panned, rotated, and zoomed using the mouse.
